#  Min-Max Normalization Workshop

This repository contains our team's submission for the **Active Learning Workshop** focused on manual Min-Max normalization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and collaborative peer review using **Jupyter Notebooks** and **GitHub**.

## Contents

- `normalization_workshop.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with:
  - Markdown documentation
  - Manual Min-Max normalization code
  - Talking point added during peer review
- `housing_data.csv` – Real estate dataset used for normalization
- `README.md` – Project overview and team details

## Dataset Description

**File:** `housing_data.csv`

A real estate dataset containing various features related to housing attributes.

| Column Name     | Description                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| House_ID        | Unique identifier for each house           |
| Price           | Market price of the house (CAD)            |
| Area_sqft       | Size of the house in square feet           |
| Num_Bedrooms    | Number of bedrooms                         |
| Num_Bathrooms   | Number of bathrooms                        |
| Year_Built      | Year the house was built                   |
| Lot_Size        | Size of the property lot in square feet    |

## Workshop Goals

- Manually implement **Min-Max normalization** without using libraries like NumPy or sklearn.
- Clearly document each step using **Markdown** cells in Jupyter Notebook.
- Review peer code and insert a **"talking point"** as part of collaborative feedback.
- Practice reproducible workflows using **Git and GitHub**.

##  How to Run

1. Open `normalization_workshop.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
2. Ensure the `housing_data.csv` file is in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Run each cell sequentially to explore, normalize, and preview the dataset.
