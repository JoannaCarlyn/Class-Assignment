Workshop Goals
Manually implement Min-Max normalization without libraries.

Clearly document each step using Markdown cells.

Collaboratively review peer code and provide feedback ("talking point").

Practice reproducible workflows with Git & GitHub.

 How to Run
Open normalization_workshop.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Ensure housing_data.csv is in the same directory.

Run each cell to explore, normalize, and preview the dataset.
